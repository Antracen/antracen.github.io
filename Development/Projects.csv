Virtual Rubik's Cube,../Development/JS/rubiks/cube&../Development/JS/rubiks/square&../Development/JS/rubiks/rubiks,rubiks,p5/p5&p5/p5.dom,Control the puzzle with (G/H) (F/J) (K/I) (D/E) (V/N) (W/O) (B/Y) (A/Ö) (U/M) (Spacebar to scramble) (Enter to start/stop timer) <br> The graphics are optimal for speedcubing. For a more traditional experience check out my other cube project.
3D Raycasting Engine,../Development/JS/3d,3d,p5/p5&p5/p5.dom,This 3D engine uses Raycasting. Build a map and start the game to walk around on it. Walk with WASD and move camera with arrow keys.
2048 Clone,../Development/JS/2048,2048,p5/p5,This is a clone of the popular game 2048. Move with arrow keys to combine bricks and try to get as large of a number as possible.
Raycasting Visualization,../Development/JS/raycast,raycast,p5/p5,Visualizing how raycasting works. Rays are cast from the player. The size of a wall depends on the length of the ray from the player to the wall. Walk with WASD and look with mouse (press canvas to capture mouse and escape to uncapture)
Tic-Tac-Toe MiniMax AI,../Development/JS/tictac,tictac,p5/p5,Take turns trying to beat the MiniMax AI at the game. Play with mouse.
A* Pathfinding Algorithm,../Development/JS/astar,astar,p5/p5&p5/p5.dom,This pathfinder uses the A* algorithm to find the shortest path from the green start to the red goal. Place walls with mouse and run with the buttons below the canvas.
Conway's Game of Life,../Development/JS/gameoflife,gameoflife,p5/p5&p5/p5.dom,Conway's Game of Life is a simulation based on some simple rules which yield beautiful results. Play around with it by using the buttons to the right of the canvas.
Tetris Clone,../Development/JS/tetris,tetris,p5/p5,Play the classig game of Tetris with your arrow keys.
Mandelbrot Image Generation,../Development/JS/mandelbrot,mandelbrot,p5/p5,The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers C for which the recursive formula Z_{n+1} = Z_n^2 + C does not go to infinity for Z_0 = 0. In this illustration the color of a pixel (x y) is based on the number of iterations until |Z| > 2 for the complex number x + yi.
Complex Numbers Drawing,../Development/JS/complexdraw,complexdraw,p5/p5,This drawing program uses complex numbers to represent pixels on the screen. Through operations on the numbers the canvas can be rotated and translated. Draw with mouse and then rotate with arrow keys and translate with WASD.
Hanzi Practice,../Development/JS/hanzipractice,hanzipractice,p5/p5&p5/p5.dom,Use this website to practice the writing of chinese or japanese character (or whatever else you might want). Either load an existing lesson or upload your own file where each line is a tab-separated pair of keyword and answer. The site uses local storage to remember the state of your last visit. Use S to show answer; N to get a new character; space to show answer or show new character and H to show help.
Fourier Series Visualization,../Development/JS/fourier,fourier,p5/p5,Visualization of a sine series square wave. Each circle comes from a term in the series.
Tiny Wings Clone,../Development/JS/sinywings,sinywings,p5/p5,Clone of the game Tiny Wings. Control with the z key.
Virtual Rubik's Cube V2,../Development/JS/cube_2,cube_2,p5/p5,Control the puzzle with (G/H) (F/J) (K/I) (D/E) (V/N) (W/O) (B/Y) (A/Ö) (U/M) (Spacebar to scramble). These graphics are pretty but not optimal for speedsolving. Speedsolvers should check out my other virtual cube.
