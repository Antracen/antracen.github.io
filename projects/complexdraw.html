	<body bgcolor="#2d2d2d">All drawn points are represented as complex numbers in the form (X+Y*i). By multiplying the numbers with other complex numbers we can transform the existing points. For example a multiplication by (0 + 1*i) rotates all points 90 degrees. Use arrow keys to rotate and scale, space to mirror image. Move points with WASD.<br></body>
